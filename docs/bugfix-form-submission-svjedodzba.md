# Form Submission Bug Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
When attempting to submit the "Svjedod≈æba" form (Certificate form) in the DocumentEntryForm, clicking the "Spremi" (Save) button and confirming in the modal dialog did not result in any data being saved. The form submission was not reaching the backend controller endpoint `/saveCertificate`.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was traced to an incorrect implementation of the confirmation modal and form submission logic. There were two main problems:

1. **Modal Form Conflict**
   - The confirmation modal contained its own `<form>` element with a different action
   ```html
   <div class="modal-footer">
       <form action="/main" method="get">  <!-- This was incorrect -->
           <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" onclick="submitForm()">Potvrdi</button>
           ...
       </form>
   </div>
   ```
   - This nested form was intercepting the submission and redirecting to `/main` without sending the form data

2. **JavaScript Implementation**
   - The `openConfirmationModal()` function stored the form reference incorrectly
   - The `submitForm()` function referenced in the modal button's onclick event was not properly implemented
   - There was no proper mechanism to submit the original form after confirmation

## Solution Implementation

### 1. JavaScript Fixes (scripts.js)
```javascript
function openConfirmationModal(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    window.formToSubmit = event.target; // Store the form globally
    const confirmationModal = new bootstrap.Modal(document.getElementById('confirmationModal'));
    confirmationModal.show();
}

// New function to handle form submission
function confirmAndSubmitForm() {
    if (window.formToSubmit) {
        sessionStorage.setItem('showToast', 'true');
        window.formToSubmit.submit();
    }
}
```

### 2. Modal HTML Fixes (DocumentEntryForm.html)
```html
<div class="modal-footer">
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" onclick="confirmAndSubmitForm()">Potvrdi</button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Nazad</button>
</div>
```

## Key Changes Made
1. Removed the nested form from the modal dialog
2. Implemented proper form reference storage using `window.formToSubmit`
3. Created a new `confirmAndSubmitForm()` function to handle the actual form submission
4. Updated the modal's confirm button to call the correct submission function
5. Maintained the toast notification functionality using sessionStorage

## Testing Verification
After implementing these changes:
1. The form submission successfully reaches the backend controller
2. Data is properly saved to the database
3. User is redirected to the main page after submission
4. Success toast notification is displayed

## Technical Impact
- Improved form submission reliability
- Eliminated conflicting form actions
- Maintained user experience with confirmation modal
- Preserved success notification functionality

## Best Practices Learned
1. Avoid nesting forms in HTML as it can lead to unexpected behavior
2. Use global window object carefully when needed to store temporary form references
3. Implement proper event prevention and handling for modal confirmations
4. Maintain clear separation between modal UI and form submission logic

## Future Considerations
1. Consider implementing a more robust form handling system for multiple forms
2. Add client-side validation before form submission
3. Implement better error handling and user feedback
4. Consider using AJAX for form submissions to prevent full page reloads
